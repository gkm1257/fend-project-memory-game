## Instructions

There are 16 cards on the board with 1 symbol on one side of each card. Total 8 different pairs of symbols are randomly arranged to each card. To start the game, just click on any card on the board and the timer will start running.

You first flip over one card, then flip another card, trying to find the same symbol as the first one. If 2 cards are matched, they will stay open. Otherwise the cards will turn face down again. One comparison is counted as 1 move.

Be careful of every movement, your `star rating` may reduce after too many moves! You will win the game once all the cards have flipped and matched. There is also a `timer` running on top right corner, try to finish the game as fast as you can.

If you get stuck or want to start all over again, just click the `restart icon` to start from the very beginning.
